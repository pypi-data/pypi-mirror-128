
This is the 'Math' module. It is made to make your life easier by writing less code! it has multiple Math methods to perform advance code by just writing a line. 

For example:- To find the last item of the list you would use var_name[-1] in a method but with the Math module you just need to do Math.last([your_list_or_var_here])

Note: You can find various functions, although using 'Kite' or 'Tabine' will make it easier by describing them to you... not sponsored.
