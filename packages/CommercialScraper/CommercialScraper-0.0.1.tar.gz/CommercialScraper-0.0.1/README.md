```

## Usage
```python
from CommercialScraper.pipeline import AirbnbScraper
from CommercialScraper.data_save import Save

scraper = AirbnbScraper()

# Returns a dictionary of structured data and a list of image sources for a single product page
product_dict, imgs = scraper.scrape_product_data('https://any/airbnb/product/page', any_ID_you_wish, 'Any Category Label you wish')

# Returns a dataframe of product entries as well as a dictionary of image sources pertaining to each product entry
df, imgs = scraper.scrape_all()


# Initialise an instance of the saver object to save yielded data where you wish
saver = Save(df, imgs)

# Saves the dataframe to a csv in your local directory inside a created 'data/' folder. 
# Structured data can be saved in numerous formats, image data can only be saved in .png files
