DBUtils
=======

DBUtils is a suite of tools providing solid, persistent and pooled connections
to a database that can be used in all kinds of multi-threaded environments.

The suite supports DB-API 2 compliant database interfaces
and the classic PyGreSQL interface.

The current version 2.0.3 of DBUtils supports Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 to 3.10.
