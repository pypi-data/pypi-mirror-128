HTSeq is a Python package for high-throughput sequencing assays.

* For a high-level description of the package, see the :ref:`overview`.

* For downloads and installation instructions, see :ref:`install`.

* For an example on the kind of analyses you can do with HTSeq and the design of
  the package, see :ref:`tour`.

* For documentation on `htseq-count`, see :ref:`htseqcount`.
  
* See the reference documentation for details on specific functions.
