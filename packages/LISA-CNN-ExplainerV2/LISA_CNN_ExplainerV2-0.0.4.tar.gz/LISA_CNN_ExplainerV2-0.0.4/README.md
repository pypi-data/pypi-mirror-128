# Explain LISA
It takes the following.
img: local path of img to be explained
class_names: the classes available as predictions for the given model
img_shape: shape of the image accepts by the neural network
model: the model to be explained get from tf.keras.models.load_model("your model path")
img1: local path background data point for produce explanations with SHAP
img2: local path background data point for produce explanations with SHAP
scale: for manual image scaling if scaling layer absent in the model to be explained 
filter_radius: the pixel value of the radius of the High pass filter

## Installation
```pip install LISA_CNN_ExplainerV2```

## How to use it?
Open terminal and type python/python3 according to your OS.


``` import LISA_CNN_ExplainerV2 as e \n```  

``` e.ExplainLISA(img,class_names,img_shape,model,img1,img2,scale,filter_radius) \n```

``` ExplainLISA.displayImages() \n```
