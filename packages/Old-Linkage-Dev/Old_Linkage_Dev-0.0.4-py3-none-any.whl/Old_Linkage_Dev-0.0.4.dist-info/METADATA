# Old-Linkage-Dev (OLD)
Old Linkage Development is a module to develop and apply old-style links.
Old-style links stand for some traditional or conventional way of access, like
TTY, Telnet, Command Line Interface, BBS, etc. Sometimes we seek for the old
days, but finding that it is lost, sometimes we found it is ridiculous that we
use HD screen to simulate CRTs, use new printing techs to print <S.>, use HTML
of hundreds kbs to hold few bytes of To, Regards.
How I wish there could be a super small kit for us to develop our tiny Telnet
BBS, our easy Console UI, our e-mail access with own domain. This is why OLD
is developed.

It now contains two main modules, that is
1. Telnet Extend Lib (TEL)
2. CLI Lib for Interaction (CLI)

# Telnet Extend Lib (TEL)
This is a set of simple Telnet tool kits, now supporting only few rfcs (RFC857,
RFC858, RFC1091, RFC1073). However, that is adequate for applying an ASCII
Animation site or a small BBS. Here are some examples:
Still Alive:    telnet://dynascii.tarcadia.site:6023
Bad Apple:      telnet://dynascii.tarcadia.site:6024

# CLI Lib for Interaction (CLI)
This is a set of simple tools to develop a Command Line UI. It provides several
designed draw methods, elements and a resource structure to organize the inter-
action of it.
It is still under construction yet.
