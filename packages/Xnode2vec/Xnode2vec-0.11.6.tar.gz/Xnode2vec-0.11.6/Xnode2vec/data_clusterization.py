    Description

    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph()
        Gives the network that will be modified.
    delta :  float

    Description
    -----------
    Performs FastNode2Vec algorithm with full control on the crucial parameters.
    In particular, this function allows the user to keep working with networkx objects
    -- that are generally quite user-friendly -- instead of the ones required by the fastnode2vec
    algorithm.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph object
        Sets the network that will be analyzed by the algorithm.
    p : float
        Sets the probability '1/p' necessary to perform the fastnode2vec random walk. It affects how often the walk is
        going to immediately revisit the previous node. The smaller it is, the more likely the node will be revisited.
    q : float
        Sets the probability '1/q' necessary to perform the fastnode2vec random walk. It affects how far the walk
        will go into the network. The smaller it is, the larger will be the distance from the initial node.
    graph : fastnode2vec.Graph object, optional
        Tells if the algorithm should perform a **networkx** to **Graph** conversion first, or if it has been already 
        done.
        The default value is 'None'.
    node : int, optional
        Sets the node from which to start the analysis. This is a gensim.models.word2vec parameter.
        The default value is '1'.
    walk_length : int
        Sets the number of jumps to perform from node to node.
    save_model : bool, optional
        Saves in the working directory a .wordvectors file that contains the performed training.
        It's important to consider is that the **methods** of the "Word2Vec" model saved can be accessed
        as "model_name.wv". The documentation of ".wv" is found however under 
        "gensim.models.keyedvectors.KeyedVectors" istance; they are the same thing, ".wv" is just a rename.
        The default value is 'False'.
    picked : int, optional
        Sets the first 'picked' nodes that are most similar to the node identified with 'node'. This is a
        gensim.models.word2vec parameter.
        The default value is '10'.
    train_time : int, optional
        Sets the number of times we want to apply the algorithm. It is the 'epochs' parameter in Node2Vec.
        The value of this parameter drastically affect the computational time.
        The default value is '5'.
    Weight : bool, optional
        Specifies if the algorithm must also consider the weights of the links. If the networks is unweighted this
        parameter must be 'False', otherwise it receives too many parameters to unpack.
        The default value is 'False'.
    dim : int, optional
        This is the Word2Vec "size" argument. It sets the dimension of the algorithm word vector. The longer it is, the
        more complex is the specification of the word -- object. If a subject has few features, the word length should
        be relatively short.
        The default value is '128'.
    context : int, optional
        This is the Word2Vec `window` parameter. Depending on its value, it manages to obtain words that are
        interchangeable and relatable -- belonging to the same topic. If the value is small, 2-15, then we will likely
        have interchangeable words, while if it is large, >15, we will have relatable words.
        It is namely the maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a `sentence`.
        The default value is '10'
        
    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray, ndarray
        The output of the function is a tuple of two numpy arrays. The first contains the top 'picked' most similar
        nodes to the 'node' one, while the second contains their similarities with respect to the 'node' one. The
        similarity is calculated as the `cosine similarity` between the vectors relative to the words themselves.
        Clearly, the dimension of the word vectors is given by `dim` parameter.
        
    Notes
    -----
    - The node parameter is by default an integer. However, this only depends on the node labels that are given to the
      nodes in the network.
    - The rest of the parameters in **kwargs are the ones in fastnode2vec.Node2Vec constructor, I only specified what I
      considered to be the most important ones.

        Description
        -----------
        This function detects the **clusters** that compose a generic dataset. The dataset must be given as a
        **networkx** graph, using the proper data transformation. The clustering procedure uses Node2Vec algorithm to
        find the most similar nodes in the network.
        Parameters
        ----------
        G : networkx.Graph()
            Gives the network that will be analyzed.
        cluster_rigidity : float, optional
            Sets the similarity threshold of the nodes. It should be a number between 0 and 1. The default value is
            '0.7'.
        spacing : int, optional
            Sets the increment of the position when picking the nodes for the analysis. The nodes are picked every
            *spacing* value between the initial node label and the last one. The default value is '5'.
        dim_fraction : float, optional
            Sets the minumum threshold for choosing when to expand the previously generated cluster. This parameter
            appears when considering the current most similar nodes picked by the Node2Vec algorithm; in particular
            it sets the minumum number of nodes that are already present in the generated clusters family before adding
            the remaining ones to the previous cluster.
        Note
        ----
        - The function returns only the nodes labels from a specific network. In order to go back to the initial points
          it's necessary to use the function **xn2v.recover_points(dataset,Graph,Clusters[i])**. Up to now, you can
          insert only a one-dimensional vector inside **xn2v.recover_points()**, meaning that if you have N clusters
          inside the list obtained by **xn2v.clusters_detection()** you'll have to call **xn2v.recover_points()**
          N times.
        Returns
        -------
        output : list
            The output is list of numpy arrays containing nodes labels from the given network *G*. Each array represents
            a specific cluster.
