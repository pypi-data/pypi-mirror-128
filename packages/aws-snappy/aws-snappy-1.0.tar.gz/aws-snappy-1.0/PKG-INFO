Description: # Snappy
        
        Snappy is a Python library that facilitates taking root volume snapshots as well from an instance.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Assuming that you have Python and virtualenv installed, set up your environment and install the required dependencies using pip:
        
        ```
        pip install aws-snappy
        ```
        
        ## Using Snappy
        
        After installing snappy, you need to import the main Snappy object and instantiate it to create a connection to AWS:
        
        ```
        from snappy.snappy import Snappy
        
        snappy = Snappy(instances)
        ```
        
        Here,
        
        `instances` is your list of instances to take snapshots of. i.e. ['10.10.10.10', 'my_instance_name']
        Instance can be indentified both by their private IP address or the instance name in the same list.
        Snappy will break them apart and search them respectively.
        
        ### Available function for Snappy Object
        
        *snap_roots(tags_specifications)*
        
        This function will take a snapshot of the root volume of the specified instances and return the output in a list in the following format:
        
        #### Parameters
        
        *tags_specifications*: A list of dictionaries containing the tags to be applied to the snapshots in the following format:
        
        ```
        [{
            "Key": "",
            "Value": ""
        }]
        ```
        
        
        #### Output
        ```
        [
            {
                "SnapshotID": "",
                "InstanceName": "",
                "VolumeID": "",
            },
            .
            .
            .
        ]
        ```
        
        
        ## Running Tests
        You can run the tests by following the steps below:
        
        1. Clone or download the project to a folder on your computer.
        2. Connect to AWS using AWS CLI
        3. Run the tests using the command `./run_test.sh`
