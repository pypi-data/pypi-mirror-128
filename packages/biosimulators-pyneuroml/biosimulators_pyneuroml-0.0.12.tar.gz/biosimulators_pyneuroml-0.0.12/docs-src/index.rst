BioSimulators-pyNeuroML documentation
=====================================

BioSimulators-pyNeuroML provides `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org>`_-compliant command-line interfaces for the `jNeuroML <https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML>`_ / `pyNeuroML <https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML>`_, `NetPyNE <http://netpyne.org>`_, and `NEURON <https://neuron.yale.edu/>`_ biological simulation tools. Docker images for these package are also available.

These command-line interfaces and Docker images enable users to use jNeuroML/pyNeuroML, NetPyNe, and NEURON to execute `COMBINE/OMEX archives <https://combinearchive.org/>`_ that describe one or more simulation experiments (in `SED-ML format <https://sed-ml.org>`_) of one or more models (in `NeuroML <https://neuroml.org/>`_ / `LEMS <https://lems.github.io/LEMS/>`_ format).

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by jNeuroML/pyNeuroML, NetPyNe, and NEURON is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators>`_.

A simple web application and web service for using jNeuroML/pyNeuroML, NetPyNe, and NEURON to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at `runBioSimulations <https://run.biosimulations.org>`_.
