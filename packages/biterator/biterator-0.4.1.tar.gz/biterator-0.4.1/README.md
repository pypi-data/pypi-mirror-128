# Biterator

__Biterator is a Python library for dealing with bits. One at a time. But in a nice way.__

The name biterator is a portmanteau of the words 'bit' and 'iterator' which hints at the core utility of this package.
Two of the most useful tools are:

1. [`biterator.biterate()`](biterator/_biterators.py)
2. [`biterator.Bits()`](biterator/_bits.py)

The `biterate()` function attempts to yield the most logical sequence of bits (as Booleans) for any given iterable
object (and even *some* objects that are not typically iterable, like integers).

The `Bits()` class expands upon this functionality by storing parsed bits and supporting all bitwise operators. It also
defines many methods that facilitate manipulation for convenience of use.

## Installation

The biterator library is pip installable:

```shell
pip install biterator
```

## Usage

### Some straightforward examples using the `biterate()` function:

```python
from biterator import biterate
```

Iterate a list of booleans.

```python
list(biterate([True, False, True, False]))
# [True, False, True, False]
```

Iterate a tuple of integer 0 and 1 literals.

```python
list(biterate(tuple([1, 0, 1, 0])))
# [True, False, True, False]
```

Iterate a list of string "0" and "1" literals.

```python
list(biterate(["1", "0", "1", "0"]))
# [True, False, True, False]
```

### Some more advanced examples:

Iterate a string containing a prefixed binary number.

```python
list(biterate("0b1010"))
# [True, False, True, False]
```

Iterate the bits of an integer, given it's total bit_length.

```python
list(biterate(bit_values=10, bit_length=6))
# [False, False, True, False, True, False]
```

Iterate the bits of a raw byte-string.

```python
list(biterate(b"U"))
# [False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True]
```

Iterate the bits of an integer represented as a prefixed hexadecimal string.

```python
list(biterate("0xAF"))
# [True, False, True, False, True, True, True, True]
```

Iterate a generator.

```python
list(biterate(i % 2 for i in range(4)))
# [False, True, False, True]
```

### Examples with `Bits()`

The `Bits()` class expands upon the utility of `biterate()` by efficiently storing bits as they are iterated over.
`Bits()` support all bitwise operators and handle concatenation gracefully.

```python
from biterator import Bits
```

Instantiate with all the same types supported by biterate.

```python
bits = Bits('0101')
list(bits)
# [False, True, False, True]
```

Supports concatenation with naked biterable types.

```python
"0xFF" + bits + "0000"
# Bits("0b1111111101010000")
```

Supports all bitwise operators, also works with naked biterable types.

```python
(Bits("1100") | Bits("0011")) & "1111"
# Bits("0b1111")
```

Supports slicing.

```python
Bits('10101010')[0:8:2]
# Bits("0b1111")
```

### `Bits()` supports a variety of ways to represent data.

Binary.

```python
Bits("0xDEADBEEF").bin()
# '0b1101_1110 0b1010_1101 0b1011_1110 0b1110_1111'
```

Hexadecimal.

```python
Bits("0b10111010110111000000110111100101").hex(compact=True)
# '0xBADC0DE5'
```

Raw bytes (instantiated from an integer with provided bit_length).

```python
bytes(Bits(5735816763073854918203775149089, 104))
# b'Hello, World!'
```

Decode bytes with your favorite encoder!

```python
Bits("0x4F682C206869204D61726B21F09F988A").decode("utf-8")
# 'Oh, hi Mark!ðŸ˜Š'
```

### Quickly implement complex bit operations!

Implement a symmetric XOR cypher with ease! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher

```python
secret_code = Bits('0xBF658DC46D3068D57F9F61DBC676666A9A689E75DBD46F31')

def xor_cypher(msg: Bits, key: Bits):
    return Bits(a ^ b for i in range(0, len(msg), len(key)) for a, b in zip(msg[i: i + len(key)], key))

decrypted = xor_cypher(secret_code, Bits("0xF100FBA11"))
bytes(decrypted)
# b'Never gonna give you up!'
```

Because it's symmetric, you change it back with the same key!

```python
secret_code == xor_cypher(decrypted, Bits("0xF100FBA11"))
# True
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate and follow all linting procedures prescribed by the project file.

## Development install

To set up the development environment, fork or clone the repo and from inside the project directory run the following is
a shell separate from pycharm (Windows machines will need to run a shell with admin privileges):

```shell
sudo ./init-development.sh
```

On Windows, PyCharm will need to be fully closed and restarted.

This will install pyenv, poetry, and activate the git-hooks for the pre-commit config.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/) is used to manage the virtual environment, to add packages use:
`poetry add <package_name>`. Please visit the poetry website for further information and instruction.

Git hooks will run linting, type checking, and pythons on commit, if any checks fail the commit will be rejected.

## TODO

__Milestones for Version 1.0.0 release:__

- [ ] Create UnitTest suite.
- [ ] Code coverage in git-hooks.
- [ ] Create a workflow that publishes on PR merge to master.
- [ ] Workflow to bump patch on each commit, bump minor on each merge to master (major bump is left as manual)
- [ ] Add agument parsing to init-development.sh to allow uninstalling.
- [ ] Git hook to assert pyproject.toml matches .python-version and that version is installed
- [ ] Git hook to update pyenv on all OS's
- [ ] Git hook to create requrirements.txt (investigate if there is actual need for this)
- [ ] Add more of the default pre-commit-hooks for line endings etc.
- [ ] Add install validation to init-development.sh script.
- [ ] In init-development.sh, validate that pyenv-win\bin and pyenv-win\shims has not already been added to path.
