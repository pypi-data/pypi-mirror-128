"""Padchest TB dataset for computer-aided diagnosis

A large chest x-ray image dataset with multi-label annotated reports.
This dataset includes more than 160,000 images from 67,000 patients that were 
interpreted and reported by radiologists at Hospital San Juan (Spain) from 2009
to 2017, covering six different position views and additional information on
image acquisition and patient demography.

We keep only "PA" images here and only the "Tuberculosis" subset with an
equivalent number of "normal" images.
