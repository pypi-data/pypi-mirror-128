"""Shenzhen dataset for computer-aided diagnosis
(extended with DensenetRS predictions)

The standard digital image database for Tuberculosis is created by the 
National Library of Medicine, Maryland, USA in collaboration with Shenzhen 
No.3 Peopleâ€™s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China. 
The Chest X-rays are from out-patient clinics, and were captured as part of 
the daily routine using Philips DR Digital Diagnose systems. 

* Reference: [MONTGOMERY-SHENZHEN-2014]_
* Original resolution (height x width or width x height): 3000 x 3000 or less
* Split reference: none
* Protocol ``default``:

  * Training samples: 64% of TB and healthy CXR (including labels)
  * Validation samples: 16% of TB and healthy CXR (including labels)
  * Test samples: 20% of TB and healthy CXR (including labels)
