Description: Brightway2.5
        ============
        
        Brightway 2.5 is the next generation of the [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev/) framework for life cycle assessment. It provides new capabilities for cloud computing and model interaction, with the use of a new [processed data library](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_processing) and a separation between the calculation library and a library for [matrix construction and manipulation](https://github.com/brightway-lca/matrix_utils).
        
        Note that this library does not import anything, so running `from brightway25 import *` won't do anything useful. Instead, import each constituent library separately. A good default is:
        
        ```python
        
        import bw2analyzer as ba
        import bw2data as bd
        import bw2calc as bc
        import bw2io as bi
        import matrix_utils as mu
        import bw_processing as bp
        
        ```
        
        # Upgrading
        
        Brightway 2.5 can be use in parallel with Brightway 2, but each project must be either version 2 or 2.5. Brightway 2.5 projects have a different processed data format, and no longer use the `mapping` object.
        
        To upgrade an existing project to version 2.5, use the function `bw2data.projects.migrate_project_25()`.
        
        To maintain a clean separation between these two sets of projects, you can use some type of naming convention, or use an [environment variable](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/faq.html?#how-do-i-find-where-my-data-is-saved) for a new data directory.
