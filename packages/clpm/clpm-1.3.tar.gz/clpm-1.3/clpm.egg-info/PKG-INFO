Description: # CLPM: A command-line password manager. 
        ### About 
        My goal for this project is to create an easy-to-use out-of-the-box password manager accessible through the command-line. The passwords are encrypted using 256 bit AES and the master password is hashed using 256 bit SHA-3. The master password is used to generate a key for encryption and for accessing the accounts using the UI. 
        
        ## Installation
        Just install through pip. 
        ```
        pip install clpm
        ```
        Then run `clpm init` to initialize the database.
        A prompt & confirmation will appear to input a master password.
        
        ### TODO
        * Encrypt all account information rather than just passwords.
        * Add usage to the README.
        * Revamp menu.
        * Fix double init/reset error
