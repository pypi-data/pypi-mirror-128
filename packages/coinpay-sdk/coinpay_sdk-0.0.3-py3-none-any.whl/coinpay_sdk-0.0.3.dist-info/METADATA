pay = CoinPay(api_key=api_key,
              api_secret=api_secret,

def get_total_balance(view_currency) -> float:
    """

    :param view_currency: currency for total balance
    :return: total balance amount for account
    """
    result = pay.get_balance()
    balance_dict = result.get('balance')
    total = 0
    for currency in balance_dict:
        total += ((balance_dict.get(currency).get(view_currency).get('total')) +
                  (balance_dict.get(currency).get(view_currency).get('reserved')))
    return total
print(get_total_balance('BTC'))
