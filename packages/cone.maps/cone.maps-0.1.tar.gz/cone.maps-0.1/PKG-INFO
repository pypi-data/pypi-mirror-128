        This package provides maps integration in to cone.app.
        
        * As maps library, `Leaflet JS <https://leafletjs.com/>`_ (v1.7.1) is included.
          It utilizes `Leaflet JS <https://leafletjs.com/>`_.
        
        * For avoiding 1px gap between tiles,
          `Leaflet.TileLayer.NoGap <https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.TileLayer.NoGap>`_
          `(ab4f107) <https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.TileLayer.NoGap/commit/ab4f107fecb80e12ffbdc4ebbedf5f85b8da7173>`_ is included.
        
        * For geocoding,
          `leaflet-geosearch <https://smeijer.github.io/leaflet-geosearch>`_
          (3.5.0) is included.
        
        * For grouping of map markers,
          `Leaflet.markercluster <https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster>`_
          (1.5.3) is included.
        
        * For defining active map area, e.g. if parts of a map is used as background,
          `Leaflet-active-area <https://github.com/Mappy/Leaflet-active-area>`_
          (1.2.0) is included.
        
        * For general CRS projection support,
          `proj4js <https://github.com/proj4js/proj4js>`_ (2.7.5) and
          `Proj4Leaflet <https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet>`_ (1.0.2)
          are included
        
        
        Map Widget
        ----------
        
        A map widget tile is included which provides OOTB default map behavior and
        can be used as starting point for complex custom maps.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from cone.maps.browser.map import MapTile
            from cone.tile import tile
            from myplugin import MyModel
        
            @tile(name='map', interface=MyModel)
            class MyMap(MapTile):
                """See ``cone.maps.browser.map`` for available tile options.
                """
