Your current Python Environment\n2. Your project's manifest (e.g. `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock` or `requirements.txt`)\n3. Conda as a Package Manager\n\nThe BOM will contain an aggregate of all your current project's dependencies, or those defined by the manifest you supply.\n\nCycloneDX is a lightweight BOM specification that is easily created, human-readable, and simple to parse.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall this from [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/cyclonedx-bom/) using your preferred Python package manager.\n\nExample using `pip`:\n```\npip install cyclonedx-bom\n```\n\nExample using `poetry`:\n```\npoetry add cyclonedx-bom\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can access the full documentation by running `--help`:\n\n```\n$ cyclonedx-bom --help\nusage: cyclonedx-bom [-h] (-c | -cj | -e | -p | -pip | -r) [-i FILE_PATH]\n                 [--format {json,xml}] [--schema-version {1.3,1.2,1.1,1.0}]\n                 [-o FILE_PATH] [-F] [-X]\n\nCycloneDX SBOM Generator\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -c, --conda           Build a SBOM based on the output from `conda list\n                        --explicit` or `conda list --explicit --md5`\n  -cj, --conda-json     Build a SBOM based on the output from `conda list\n                        --json`\n  -e, --e, --environment\n                        Build a SBOM based on the packages installed in your\n                        current Python environment (default)\n  -p, --p, --poetry     Build a SBOM based on a Poetry poetry.lock's contents.\n                        Use with -i to specify absolute pathto a `poetry.lock`\n                        you wish to use, else we'll look for one in the\n                        current working directory.\n  -pip, --pip           Build a SBOM based on a PipEnv Pipfile.lock's\n                        contents. Use with -i to specify absolute pathto a\n                        `Pipefile.lock` you wish to use, else we'll look for\n                        one in the current working directory.\n  -r, --r, --requirements\n                        Build a SBOM based on a requirements.txt's contents.\n                        Use with -i to specify absolute pathto a\n                        `requirements.txt` you wish to use, else we'll look\n                        for one in the current working directory.\n  -X                    Enable debug output\n\nInput Method:\n  Flags to determine how `cyclonedx-bom` obtains it's input\n\n  -i FILE_PATH, --in-file FILE_PATH\n                        File to read input from, or STDIN if not specified\n\nSBOM Output Configuration:\n  Choose the output format and schema version\n\n  --format {json,xml}   The output format for your SBOM (default: xml)\n  --schema-version {1.3,1.2,1.1,1.0}\n                        The CycloneDX schema version for your SBOM (default:\n                        1.3)\n  -o FILE_PATH, --o FILE_PATH, --output FILE_PATH\n                        Output file path for your SBOM (set to '-' to output\n                        to STDOUT)\n  -F, --force           If outputting to a file and the stated file already\n                        exists, it will be overwritten.\n```\n\n### Building CycloneDX for your current Python environment\n\nThis will produce the most accurate and complete CycloneDX BOM as it will include all transitive dependencies required\nby the packages defined in your project's manifest (think `requriements.txt`).\n\nWhen using _Environment_ as the source, any license information available from the installed packages will also be \nincluded in the generated CycloneDX BOM.\n\nSimply run:\n\n```\ncyclonedx-bom -e -o -\n```\n\nThis will generate a CycloneDX including all packages installed in your current Python environment and output to STDOUT\nin XML using the latest schema version `1.3` by default.\n\n\n### Building CycloneDX from your Manifest / Package Manager\n\n_Note: Manifest scanning limits the amount of information available. Each manifest type contains different information\nbut all are significantly less complete than scanning your actual Python Environment._\n\n#### Conda\n\nWe support parsing output from Conda in various formats:\n- Explict output (run `conda list --explicit` or `conda list --explicit --md5`)\n- JSON output (run `conda list --json`)\n\nAs example:\n```\nconda list --explicit --md5 | cyclonedx-bom -c -o cyclonedx.xml\n```\n\n#### Poetry\n\nWe support parsing your `poetry.lock` file which should be committed along with your `pyrpoject.toml` and details\nexact pinned versions.\n\nYou can then run `cyclonedx-bom` as follows:\n```\ncyclonedx-bom -p -i PATH/TO/poetry.lock -o sbom.xml\n```\n\nIf your `poetry.lock` is in the current working directory, you can also shorten this to:\n```\ncyclonedx-bom -p -o sbom.xml\n```\n\n#### Pip\n\nWe currently support `Pipfile.lock` manifest files.\n\nYou can then run `cyclonedx-bom` as follows:\n```\ncyclonedx-bom -pip -i PATH/TO/Pipfile.lock -o sbom.xml\n```\n\nIf your `Pipfile.lock` is in the current working directory, you can also shorten this to:\n```\ncyclonedx-bom -pip -o sbom.xml\n```\n\n#### Requirements\n\nWe currently support `requirements.txt` manifest files. Note that a BOM such as CycloneDX expects exact version numbers, \ntherefore if you wish to generate a BOM from a `requirements.txt`, these must be frozen. This can be accomplished via:\n\n```\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n\nYou can then run `cyclonedx-bom` as follows:\n```\ncyclonedx-bom -r -i PATH/TO/requirements.txt -o sbom.xml\n```\n\nIf your `requirements.txt` is in the current working directory, you can also shorten this to:\n```\ncyclonedx-bom -r -o sbom.xml\n```\n\nThis will generate a CycloneDX and output to STDOUT in XML using the latest schema version `1.3` by default.\n\n**Note:** If you failed to freeze your dependencies before passing the `requirements.txt` data to `cyclonedx-bom`, \nyou'll be warned about this and the dependencies that do not have pinned versions WILL NOT be included in the resulting \nCycloneDX output.\n\n```\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n!! Some of your dependencies do not have pinned version !!\n!! numbers in your requirements.txt                     !!\n!!                                                      !!\n!! -> idna                                              !!\n!! -> requests                                          !!\n!! -> urllib3                                           !!\n!!                                                      !!\n!! The above will NOT be included in the generated      !!\n!! CycloneDX as version is a mandatory field.           !!\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n```\n\n## Python Support\n\nWe endeavour to support all functionality for all [current actively supported Python versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\nHowever, some features may not be possible/present in older Python versions due to their lack of support.\n\n## Copyright & License\n\nCycloneDX BOM is Copyright (c) OWASP Foundation.
