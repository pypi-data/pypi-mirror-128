# pypi-dnf

Dummy package reserved for any future possibility of having DNF Python API available through PyPI. Installing this package will not be completed as it is intended to be empty therefore installation failure will be thrown.

A number of DNF's dependencies (notable libdnf and libsolv) are currently
only available as part of Linux distro packages.

Right now, this package just reserves the `dnf` name on PyPI to avoid the
potential for a name conflict with the `python3-dnf` packages on Linux distros
using DNF for RPM dependency management.

However, I eventually hope to replace it with a CMake-dependent PEP 517 backend
that runs the full libdnf build process, and then emits a statically linked
completely self-contained extension module as part of a wheel file (together
with the pure Python components of the DNF Python API).
