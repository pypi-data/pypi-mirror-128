# dumpulator

**Note: This is a work-in-progress prototype, please treat it as such.**

An easy-to-use library for emulating code in minidump files.

## Example

The example below opens `test.dmp`, allocates some memory and calls the decryption function at `0x140001000` to decrypt the string at `0x140003000`:

```python
from dumpulator import Dumpulator

dp = Dumpulator("test.dmp", trace=True)
temp_addr = dp.allocate(256)
dp.call(0x140001000, [temp_addr, 0x140003000])
decrypted = dp.read_str(temp_addr)
print(f"decrypted: '{decrypted}'")
```


## Installation

To install from source:

```
python setup.py install
```

Install for a development environment:

```
python setup.py install
```

From pip (not yet available):
