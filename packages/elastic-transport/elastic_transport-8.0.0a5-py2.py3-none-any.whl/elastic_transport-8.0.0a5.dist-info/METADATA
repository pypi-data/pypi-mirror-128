Transport classes and utilities shared among Python Elastic client libraries

This library was lifted from [`elasticsearch-py`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py)
and then transformed to be used across all Elastic services
rather than only Elasticsearch.

### Installing from PyPI

```
$ python -m pip install elastic-transport
```

Versioning follows the major and minor version of the Elastic Stack version and
the patch number is incremented for bug fixes within a minor release.

## User Guide

For almost all use-cases you should not need this library.
The below use-cases are the common ones:

### Creating your own Node Class

If you need to have custom behavior for a `Node` you can subclass the
base node class you want and then pass the class in via `node_class`:

```python
from elastic_transport import Urllib3HttpNode
from elastic_enterprise_search import EnterpriseSearch


class CustomHttpNode(Urllib3HttpNode):
    def perform_request(
        self,
        method,
        target,
        body=None,
        request_timeout=DEFAULT,
        ignore_status=(),
        headers=None,
    ): ...  # Custom HTTP behavior


# Create the Client with 'node_class' defined
client = EnterpriseSearch(
    ...,
    node_class=CustomHttpNode
)
```

The above also works for `NodePool` (via `node_pool_class`) and `Transport` (via `transport_class`).

## Nodes

A node describes a single instance of a service within a potentially larger cluster.
`elastic-transport-python` supports two HTTP client libraries:

### `Urllib3HttpNode`

This is the default node class. This node class uses [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io)
to issue requests.

### `RequestsHttpNode`

This node class requires the [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)
library to be installed to use:
 
```bash
$ python -m pip install requests
```

This class is often useful when using libraries that integrate with Requests.
Read more about [Requests on Read the Docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io).

### Supported Node Options

The two node classes support a variety of options, some node classes
only support a subset of the total options:
