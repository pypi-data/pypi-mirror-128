    Provider that waits for remote commands and can cache them.

    The purpose of a provider is to give commands to be executed
    in response to :meth:`~get_command` method. This provider is
    based on the :class:`~QueueProvider` which can accumulate
    commands and issue them in the order of their arrival
    and can also block when there are no commands.

    The constructor also creates an associated :class:`~RemoteWatcher`
    that the user is expected to install into the terminal.

    This class might not be useful as it is, since the
    :class:`~RemoteRunner` sends :class:`~TextCommand` in its
    default incarnation. See
    :class:`~enhterm.provider.parser.argparser.ArgparseRemoteProvider`
    for an implementation that parses the text.
