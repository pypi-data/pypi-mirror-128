class Provider(EtBase):
    """
    A class capable of providing command to the terminal.

    To install the provider into the terminal one can provide it
    to the constructor or use the :meth:`~EnhTerm.install_provider` method.

    The purpose of this class is to provide a command to be executed when asked
    by the terminal. We define de interface here and actual implementations
    are in separate modules.

    In a terminal the providers form a stack, with the one at the
    top of the stack being the active provider (the one that is asked
    for next command via :meth:`~get_command`). The provider
    is informed that it was installed and that it is now the active provider
    via :meth:`~start`. The provider that was previously active
    is informed via :meth:`~pause`that is no longer active
    and via :meth:`~unpause`when it becomes active again
    (the provider directly above it in the attach has finished).

    To indicate that it has no other commands to provide the implementation
    should return `None` in :meth:`~get_command`. The terminal will
    then call :meth:`~stop`method to confirm that it was uninstalled.
    Same mechanism is used if an unhandled exception in the provider
    is caught by the terminal.

    Attributes:
        term (EnhTerm):
            The terminal that is serviced by this provider.
            :meth:`~EnhTerm.install_provider` and
            :meth:`~EnhTerm.uninstall_provider` will change this value.

        Arguments:
            term (EnhTerm)

        The provider is informed that it is the active provider.

        This method is called when the provider has been installed into
        the terminal and just before it is made the top provider.

        An exception in this method will cause the install procedure
        to fail and the provider will not be added to the stack.
