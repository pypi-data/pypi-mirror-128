class QueueProvider(QueueMixin, Provider):
    """
    A provider that can store and issue commands.

    If `block` is true and `timeout` is `None` (the default),
    block if necessary until an item is available. If `timeout` is
    a non-negative number, it blocks at most `timeout` seconds.

    If `block` is `False` return a :class:`~Command` if one is immediately
    available ('timeout' is ignored in that case).

    If a :class:`~Command` is not present in the queue the provider
    either uninstalls itself by returning `None` or returns the command
    defined in `on_empty` attribute (:class:`NoOpCommand` by default).

    Attributes:
        block (bool):
            Should the queue wait for a command or return immediately?
        timeout (float):
            The time to block, waiting for an item.
        on_empty (None or callable):
            If `None` the provider will return None on :meth:`~get_command`,
            causing the terminal to uninstall the provider.
            Otherwise the provider will call this member in order
            to construct the command. The constructor sets this attribute
            to either `None` or :class:`NoOpCommand`.
