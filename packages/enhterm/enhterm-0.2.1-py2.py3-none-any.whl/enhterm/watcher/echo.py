    A watcher that prints messages to text streams.

    Attributes:
        low_stream (TextIOBase):
            The stream used for messages with severity below `cutoff`.
        high_stream (TextIOBase):
            The stream used for messages with severity equal or above `cutoff`.
        cutoff (int):
            Messages have a `severity` member that is an integer from 0 to
            infinity(but usually to 50). The watcher compares `cutoff` with
            `severity` and decides on which chanel it should send the output.
