    """
    Serialize and de-serialize commands and messages.

    The class defines the interface that needs to be implemented
    by classes used for converting commands and paragraphs in messages
    into strings of bytes.
    
    The approach for the command is to directly create the bytes
    array. Paragraphs, on the other hand, are just converted to simple types
    and converting them to bytes is outside tje scope of this class.
    The reverse process also works on bytes for commands and on
    basic types for paragraphs.
