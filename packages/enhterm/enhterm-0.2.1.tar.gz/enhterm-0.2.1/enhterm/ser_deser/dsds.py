    that takes no arguments. The id is then saved on one side and used
    on the other to recreate the class.
    
    The objects handled by thos class (Command, Paragraph) implement
    the Serializable interface, meaning they have a class_id method
    an encode and a decode method. Once the object
    is constructed the raw bytes or simple types are
    provided to decode method to fully initialize the object.
