Introduction
============

estimagic is a Python package that provides high-quality and user-friendly tools
to fit large scale empirical models to data and make inferences about the estimated
model parameters. It is especially suited to solve difficult constrained optimization
problems.

estimagic provides several advantages over similar packages, including a unified
interface that supports a large number of local and global optimization algorithms
and the possibility of monitoring the optimization procedure via a beautiful
interactive dashboard.

estimagic provides tools for nonlinear optimization, numerical differentiation
and statistical inference.


Optimization
------------

- estimagic wraps all algorithms from *scipy.optimize* and many more become
  available when installing optional dependencies.
- estimagic can automatically implement many types of constraints via
  reparametrization, with any optmizer that supports simple box constraints.
- estimagic encourages name-based parameters handling. Parameters are specified
  as pandas DataFrames that can have any kind of single or MultiIndex. This is
  especially useful when specifying constraints.
- The complete history of parameters and function evaluations are saved in a
  database for maximum reproducibility and displayed in real time via an
  interactive dashboard.

Estimation and Inference
------------------------

- You can estimate a model using method of simulated moments (MSM), calculate standard
  errors and do sensitivity analysis with just one function call.
- Asymptotic standard errors for maximum likelihood estimation.
- estimagic also provides bootstrap confidence intervals and standard errors.
  Of course the bootstrap procedures are parallelized.



Numerical differentiation
-------------------------

- estimagic can calculate precise numerical derivatives using `Richardson extrapolations
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation>`_.
- Function evaluations needed for numerical derivatives can be done in parallel
  with pre-implemented or user provided batch evaluators.




Installation
============

The package can be installed via conda. To do so, type the following commands in a
terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install -c opensourceeconomics estimagic

The first line adds conda-forge to your conda channels. This is necessary for conda to
find all dependencies of estimagic. The second line installs estimagic and its
dependencies.

Documentation
=============

The documentation is hosted (`on rtd <https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_)
