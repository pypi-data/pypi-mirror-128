# Excel to gdx
A simple python tool to extract sets and parameters from excel files by creating GDX files for GAMS

See sheet name 'py' in the excel files that describes sets and parameters settings. Similar approach for https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/T_GDXXRW.html

Particularly useful for linux and ios where GDXXRW.exe is not compatible, see here: https://forum.gamsworld.org/viewtopic.php?t=10418#p24019
