    Information and Evidence Unit
    Office of the Prosecutor
    Post Office Box 19519
    2500 CM The Hague
    The Netherlands

    Hello Office of the Prosecutor,

    i write you in the context of communications and claims under
    art.15 of  the Rome Statute. i want to inform the prosecutor that
    the king of the netherlands and his government are commiting 3
    of the 5 crimes defined in the Rome Statute.

    The dutch government has introduced three new forced care laws,
    the Wfz (wet forensische zorg) for criminals, the WvGGZ (Wet 
    verplichte GGZ) for the disturbed and addicted and the Wzd (Wet 
    zorg en dwang) for the handicapped.

    Both the chamber suggesting these laws to the king and the king
    himself have been informed about the fact the the substances
    administered under these laws are proven to be poison (1).
 
    There is proof the medication used in forced treatements in the 
    netherlands are poison.

    (1) haloperiodol (:ref:`haldol`)
    https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.000.142
    (2) clozapine (:ref:`leponex`)
    https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.024.831
    (3) olanzapine (:ref:`zyprexa`)
    https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.125.320
    (4) aripriprazole (:ref:`abilify`)
    https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.112.532

    With the mass scale torture with poison the king of the netherlands and 
    his chamber:

    (1) kills
    (2) does grave bodily and mental harm
    (3) makes impotent

    on the following victim groups here in the Netherlands:

    (1) verslaafden (addicts)
    (2) bejaarden (elderly)
    (3) ggz patienten (psychiatric patients)
    (4) criminelen (criminials)
    (5) gehandicapten (handicapped)

    Since the members of the chamber and the king were aware that
    these medicine are poison at the time they voted for this law and
    the day the Wfz law took effect (1-1-2019), i ask the prosecutor
    to prosecute the king for making the commiting of the above
    mentioned crimes (killing, torture and impotent making) possible
    here in the netherlands in the hope that it stops the mass
    torture with poison the king of the netherlands and his government
    are doing.

    the king.

# CONCLUSION

    king netherlands doesn't stop his genocide, prosecutor doesn't
    stop king netherlands his genocide, king netherlands commits
    genocide.
