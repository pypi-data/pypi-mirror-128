upgrade:
  - |
    Updates the ``stackhpc.os-images`` role to version 1.10.2, for
    compatibility with the version of diskimage-builder installed by Victoria
    upper constraints. You must run ``kayobe control host upgrade`` to update
    this role in order to successfully build IPA images.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes building deployment images (IPA) with recent versions of
    ironic-python-agent-builder, by using Victoria upper constraints to install
    a newer version of diskimage-builder into the virtual environment used for
    building IPA images. This can be changed using the
    ``ipa_build_upper_constraints_file`` variable in
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/ipa.yml``.
