    @RuleCheckAny(rules.RuleIntPositive, rules.RuleFloatPositive)
    def speed_msg(speed, limit, **kwargs) -> str:
        if limit > speed:
            msg = f"Current speed is '{speed}'. You may go faster as the limit is '{limit}'."
        elif speed == limit:
            msg = f"Current speed is '{speed}'. You are at the limit."
        else:
            msg = f"Please slow down limit is '{limit}' and you are currenlty going '{speed}'."
