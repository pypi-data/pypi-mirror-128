        # Getting started:
        
        
        
        ## First: create your model:
          - create python file ex: ```my_model.py``` and write your model into it
        ```python
        from lisa_orm.db import models
        
        
        class MyModel(metaclass=models.ModelMeta):
          table_name = 'my_table_name' # -> Name your model it's mandatory
          
          my_field_one = models.CharField(max_length=40, null=True)
          my_field_two = models.IntegerField(unique=True)
        ```
          - then run your model by ```pythonX my_model.py ``` 
          - X is python version
         
         ## Second: make migrations:
           - create new file name it ```make_migrations.py``` 
           - or name it anything you want
           - write into it:
          ```python
        from lisa_orm.migrations import make_migrations
          
          
        make_migrations()
          ```
          - just run your  ```make_migrations.py``` 
          - by ```pythonX make_migrations.py```
        
        ## Third: migrate your model:
        - create file ```migrate.py```
        - or anything you want
        - and write into it:
        ```python
        from lisa_orm.migrate import migrate
        
        
        migrate()
        ```
        - run you ```migrate.py``` 
        - by ```pythonX migrate.py```
        
        ## Note: I will make ```manage.py``` to make_migrations and migrate and some other actions (Ø¥Ù† Ø´Ø§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡)
        
        <hr>
        
        ## Congratulations, you have just created your first model ðŸ˜Š
        
        <hr>
        
        # Now you can edit and add data and edit your model
        
        - ## let's add some data:
        ```python
        from lisa_orm.actions import add
        from my_model import MyModel
        
        
        add(
          model=MyModel,
          my_field_one = 'hello world!',
          my_field_two = 20
          )
          
        add(
          model=MyModel,
          my_field_one = 'i love python',
          my_field_two = 50
          )
          
        add(
          model=MyModel,
          my_field_one = 'i love lisa',
          my_field_two = 100
          )
        ```
        - now run your file ```pythonX run your_file.py```
        - you should see this output :
         ```
         data added successfully
         data added successfully
         data added successfully
         ```
         
         - you can delete a field from your model ... lets do it
         ```python
        from lisa_orm.actions import delete_field
        from my_model import MyModel
         
         
        delete_field(
            model=MyModel,
            field_name='my_field_two'
         )
         ```
         - run your file
         - you should see this output:
         ```deleted field my_field_two successfully```
        
        
        - And yo can drop your model also:
        ```python
        from lisa_orm.actions import drop
        from my_model import MyModel
        
        drop(model=MyModel)
        ```
        - run your file and you should see this output:
        ```
        deleted model MyModel successfully
        ```
        
        <hr>
        
        # Let's get our data:
        - ## you can get your all data by get_all():
        ```python
        from lisa_orm.search import get_all
        from my_model import MyModel
        
        my_data_as_dict = get_all(model=MyModel)
        my_data_as_json = get_all(model=MyModel, export_to_json=True)
        
        # by default get_all and all methods in search  returns fetched data as a dict 
        # but you can get data as json by passing export_to_json=True
        ```
        - ## you can also get 1 record from DB with get():
        ```python
        from lisa_orm.search import get
        from my_model import MyModel
        
        my_data_as_dict = get(model=MyModel)
        my_data_as_json = get(model=MyModel, export_to_json=True)
        
        # it is like get_all()
        # It's not finished yet ... it is return only first record on DB
        ```
