    Graph object, optimized for traversal.

    Edges are stored in a dictionary, the key is the source node to speed up
    finding outgoing edges. The Edges only have three pieces of data:
        - the source node (the key)
        - the target node
        - the relationship
    The target and the relationship are stored as a tuple, the edge dictionary
    stores lists of tuples.

    Nodes are stored as a B+Tree, this gives slightly slower performance
    than a dictionary but has a distinct advantage in that it sorts the
    values enabling binary searching of the dataset without loading into
    memory.
