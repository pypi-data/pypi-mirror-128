    Speed up reading sets of files - such as multiple days worth of log-per-day
    files.

    Each file is read in a separate thread, up to 8 threads, reading a single
    file using this function won't show any improvement.

    NOTE:
        This compromises record ordering to achieve speed increases

    Parameters:
        items_to_read: list of strings
            The name of the blobs to read
        reader: Reader
            The Reader object to perform the reading operations
