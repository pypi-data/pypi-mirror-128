# modxlib

__modxlib__ is a package of common functions, data, and classes used in the CTPS Model Data Explorer.

## Version Identification

__Function__: __get_version()__ - Returns version ID string of library.

## Trip Table Management

__Function__: __open\_trip\_tables(tt_dir)__

__Summary__: Given a directory containing the trip tables in OMX format for the 
four daily time periods used by the mode, open them and return 
a dictionary with the keys 'am', 'md', 'pm', and 'nt' whose
value is the corresponding open OMX file.

__Parameters__: tt_dir - directory containing trip table files in OMX format

__Return value__: A dictionary with the keys 'am', 'md', 'pm', and 'nt' whose
value is the corresponding open OMX file.

__Function__: __load\_trip_tables(tt_dir, modes=None)__

__Summary__: Load the trip tables for all time periods the specified list of modes from
open OMX files into NumPy arrays.
If no list of modes is passed, trip tables for all modes will be returned.

__Parameters__
* tt_omxs - Dictionary, keyed by time period identifier ('am', 'md', 'pm', and 'nt'),
each of whose values is the open OMX trip table file for the corresponding time period.
* modes - list of modes (strings), or None

__Return value__: A two-level dictionary (i.e., first level = time period, second level = mode)
the second level of which contain the trip table(s), in the form of a numPy array,for the \[time_period\]\[mode\] in question.

## TAZ "shapefile" Management

__Summary__: The class "tazManager" provides a set of methods to perform _attribute_ queries
on an ESRI-format "Shapefile" that represents the TAZes in the model region.
The attributes are read from the Shapefile's .DBF file; other components of
the Shapefile are ignored.

The Shapefile's .DBF file _must_ contain the following attributes:
1. id
2. taz
3. type - 'I' (internal) or 'E' (external)
4. town - town name (upper case)
5. state - state abbreviation, e.g., 'MA'
6. town_state - town, state
7. mpo - abbreviation of MPO name: 
8. in_brmpo - 1 (yes) or 0 (no)
9. subregion - abbreviation of Boston Region MPO subregion or NULL
10. sector - 'analysis sector' as defined by CTPS's Bill Kuttner.
Either 'Northeast', 'North', 'Northwest', 'West', 'Southwest',
South', 'Southeast', 'Central' or ''; the empty string ('')
indicates that the TAZ is outsize of the 164 municipalities
comprising what was once known as the 'CTPS Model Region'.

An object of class tazManager is instantiated by passing in the fully-qualified path
to a Shapefile to the class constructor. Hence, it is possible to have more than one
instance of this class active simultaneously, should this be needed.

__Class__ __tazManager__  
__Methods__:  
1. __init__(path_to_shapefile) - class constructor
2. mpo_to_tazes(mpo) - Given the name (i.e., abbreviation) of an MPO,
return a list of the records for the TAZes in it
3. brmpo_tazes() - Return the list of the records for the TAZes in the Boston Region MPO
4. brmpo_town_to_tazes(town) - Given the name of a town in the Boston Region MPO,
return a list of the records for the TAZes in it
5. brmpo_subregion_to_tazes(subregion) - Given the name (i.e., abbreviation) of a Boston Region MPO subregion,
return a list of the records for the TAZes in it
6. sector_to_tazes - Given the name of an 'analysis sector', return the list of the records for the TAZes
in the sector.
7. town_to_tazes(town) - Given the name of a town, return the list of the records for the TAZes in the town.
Note: If a town with the same name occurs in more than one state, the  list of TAZes
in _all_ such states is returned.
8. town_state_to_tazes(town, state) - Given a town and a state abbreviation (e.g., 'MA'),
return the list of records for the TAZes in the town
9. state_to_tazes(state) - Given a state abbreviation, return the list of records for the TAZes in the state.
10. taz_ids(TAZ_record_list) - Given a list of TAZ records, return a list of _only_ the TAZ IDs from those records.

__Note__: For all of the above API calls that return a "list of TAZ records", each returned 'TAZ' is a Python 'dict' containing
all of the keys (i.e., 'attributes') listed above. To convert such a list to a list of _only_ the TAZ IDs, call taz_ids
on the list of TAZ records.

## Miscellaneous Utilities for the Transit Mode

__NOTE: The transit utilities are specific to TDM19. They will be modified for TDM23.__

__Function__: __mode\_to\_metamode(mode)__

__Summary__: Given one of the 50+ transportation "modes" supported by the TDM, return its "meta mode".
For example, the model supports 3 different "modes" for MBTA bus routes; all three of 
these have the common "metamode" of 'MBTA_Bus'. The universe of metamodes consists of 'MBTA_Bus', 'Light_Rail',
'Heavy_Rail', 'Commuter_Rail', 'Ferry', 'Shuttle_Express', 'RTA', 'Private' and 'Walk'.

__Parameters__:
* mode - String identifying one of the transporation "modes" supported by the TDM.

__Return value__: String representing the input mode's "metamode."

__Function__: __import_transit_assignment(scenario)__

__Summary__: Import transit assignment result CSV files for a given scenario.

__Parameters:__:
* scenario - Path to root directory of TDM transit boarding ("ONO.csv") files for a given scenario.

__Return value__: a dict of the form:
```
{	'AM'    : dataframe with totals for the AM period,
	'MD'    : datafrme with totals for the MD period,
	'PM'    : dataframe with totals for the PM period,
	'NT'    : dataframe with totals for the NT period,
	'daily' : dataframe with totals for the entire day
}
```

## Dataframe and Geo-dataframe Utilities

__Function__: __export\_gdf\_to\_geojson(geo_dataframe, geojson_fn)__

__Summary__: Export a GeoPandas gdataframe to a GeoJSON file.

__Parameters__:
* geo_dataframe - GeoPandas dataframe
* geojson_fn - Name of GeoJSON file

__Return value__: N/A

__Function__: __export\_gdf\_to\_shapefile(geo_dataframe, shapefile_fn)__

__Summary__: Export a GeoPandas gdataframe to an ESRI-format shapefile

__Parameters__:
* geo_dataframe - GeoPandas dataframe
* geojson_fn - Name of shapefile

__Note__: Attribute (property) names longer than 10 characters will be truncated,
due to the limitations of the DBF file used for Shapefile attributes.

__Return value__: N/A

__Function__: __bbox\_of\_gdf(gdf)__

__Summar__: Return the bounding box of all the features in a geo-dataframe.

__Parameters__:   
* gdf - a GeoPandas dataframe

__Return value__: Bounding box of all the features in the input geodataframe.
The bounding box is returned as a dictionary with the keys: \{ 'minx', 'miny', 'maxx', 'maxy' \}


__Function__: __center\_of\_bbox(bbox)__

__Summary__: Given a geomtric "bounding box", return its center point. 

__Parameters__:
* bbox - Bounding box in the form of a dictionary with the keys { 'minx', 'miny', 'maxx', 'maxy'}

__Return value__: Center point of the bounding box as a dictionary with the keys { 'x' , 'y' }.
