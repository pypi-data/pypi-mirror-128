"""
Allow to deploy project.
Possible destinations: PYPI.

Check `deploy_to_pypi` function docs for how to use it.

Usually this function is not called manually, but it's a part of `push_pipeline` from utils.

Check utils docs where is described, how to use VS Code Task to be able to optionally test, push and deploy
with tasks (one button click).
