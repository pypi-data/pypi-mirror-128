# NaiveFea

A simple python library for 2D finite element analysis.

You can learn how to use it by [example.ipynb](https://github.com/MuTong320/NaiveFea/blob/master/example.ipynb) and [example_nonlinear.ipynb](https://github.com/MuTong320/NaiveFea/blob/master/example_nonlinear.ipynb).

* Linear and nonlinear elasticity;
* Easy to calculate and plot user-defined showing data;
* Support multiprocessor;
* Plot mesh, undeformed, and deformed figure, where magnificient of deformed figure can be calculate automatically.

## Pre-processing

Plot figure of mesh and restirct condition

## Solving

Solving a FEA problem within 8 lines.

```python
mesh=meshio.read('abaqus_mesh.inp')
fea=LinearFea(mesh)
material=LinearElastic(E=10.0,nv=0.3)
fea.uniform_material(material)
fea.set_deform_conditions('fix',Uxy=[0,5,10,15,20])
fea.set_force_conditions({14:(0.001,0)})
fea.submit()
fea.plot('stress','S12')
```

## Post-processing

Easy to plot figures.

## Result of two material fea

Ability to solve multi material problem.
