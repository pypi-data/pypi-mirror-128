# Nightfall Python SDK

This is a python SDK for working with the Nightfall API.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/nightfall.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/nightfall)


## Installation 

This module requires Python 3.7 or higher.

```
pip install nightfall
```

## Quickstart 

Make a new [API Token](https://app.nightfall.ai/api/) in Nightfall and store the value as an environment variable.

```python
import os

from nightfall import Confidence, DetectionRule, Detector, Nightfall

nightfall = Nightfall(os.getenv('NIGHTFALL_API_KEY'))

findings, _ = nightfall.scan_text(
        ["4916-6734-7572-5015 is my credit card number"],
        [DetectionRule(
            [Detector(min_confidence=Confidence.LIKELY,
                     nightfall_detector="CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER")])])
print(findings)
```
