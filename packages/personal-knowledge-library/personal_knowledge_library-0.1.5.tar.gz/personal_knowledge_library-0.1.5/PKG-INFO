# Wacom Personal Knowledge Library

The library and the cloud services are still under development. 
The required access tokens are only available for selected partner companies.

> :danger:  Its is still under development, so **we do not recommend using it yet for production environments**. Moreover, it is not following any formal QA and release process, yet.

## Introduction

In knowledge management there is a distinction between data, information and knowledge.
In the domain of digital ink this means:

- **Data** - The equivalent would be the ink strokes
- **Information** - After using handwriting-, shape-, math-, or other recognition processes ink strokes are converted into machine readable content, such as text, shapes, math representations, other other digital content
- **Knowledge / Semantics** -  Beyond recognition content needs to be semantically analysed to become semantically understood based on a shared common knowledge.

The following illustration shows the different layers of knowledge:
![Levels of ink knowledge layers](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/personal-knowledge-library/blob/main/assets/knowledge-levels.png)

For handling semantics, Wacom introduced the Wacom Personal Knowledge (WPK) cloud service to manage personal ontologies and its associated personal knowledge graph.

This library provide simplified access to Wacom's personal knowledge cloud service.
It contains:

- Basic datastructures for Ontology object and entities from the knowledge graph
- Clients for the REST APIs
- Connector for Wikidata public knowledge graph

**Ontology service:**

- List all Ontology structures
- Modify Ontology structures
- Delete Ontology structures

**Entity service:**

- List all entities
- Add entities to knowledge graph
- Access object properties

# Technology stack

## Domain Knowledge

The tasks of the ontology within Wacom's personal knowledge system is to formalised the domain the technology is used in, such as education-, smart home-, or creative domein.
The domain model will be the foundation for the entities collected within the knowledge graph, describing real world concepts in a formal language understood by artificial intelligence system:

- Foundation for structured data, knowledge representation as concepts and relations among concepts
- Being explicit definitions of shared vocabularies for interoperability
- Being actionable fragments of explicit knowledge that engines can use for inferencing (Reasoning)
- Can be used for problem solving

An ontology defines (specifies) the concepts, relationships, and other distinctions that are relevant for modelling a domain.

## Knowledge Graph

- Knowledge graph is generated from unstructured and structured knowledge sources
- Contains all structured knowledge gathered from all sources
- Foundation for all semantic algorithms

## Semantic Technology

- Extract knowledge from various sources (Connectors)
- Linking words to knowledge entities from graph in a given text (Ontology-based Named Entity Linking)
- Enables a smart search functionality which understands the context and finds related documents (Semantic Search)


# Functionality

## Access API

The personal knowledge graph backend is implement as a multi-tenancy system.
Thus, several tenants can be logically separated from each other and different organisations can build their one knowledge graph.

![Tenant concept](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/personal-knowledge-library/blob/main/assets/tenant-concept.png)

In general, a tenant with their users, groups, and entities are logically separated.
Physically the entities are store in the same instance of the Wacom Personal Knowledge (WPK) backend database system.

The user management is rather limited, each organisation must provide their own authentication service and user management.
The backend only has a reference of the user (*“shadow user”*) by an **external user id**.

The management of tenants is limited to the system owner - Wacom -, as it requires a **tenant management API** key.
While users for each tenant can be created by the owner of the **Tenant API Key**.
You will receive this token from the system owner after the creation of the tenant.


> :warning: Store the **Tenant API Key** in a secure key store, as attackers can use the key to harm your system.


The **Tenant API Key** should be only used by your authentication service to create shadow users and to login your user into the WPK backend.
After a successful user login, you will receive a token which can be used by the user to create, update, or delete entities and relations.

The following illustration summarizes the flows for creation of tenant and users:

![Tenant and user creation](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/personal-knowledge-library/blob/main/assets/tenant-user-creation.png)

The organisation itself needs to implement their own authentication service which:

- handles the users and their passwords,
- controls the personal data of the users,
- connects the users with the WPK backend and share with them the user token.

The WPK backend only manages the access levels of the entities and the group management for users.
The illustration shows how the access token is received from the WPK endpoint:

![Access token request.](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/personal-knowledge-library/blob/main/assets/access-token.png)

# Entity API

The entities used within the knowledge graph and the relationship among them is defined within an ontology that is manage with Wacom Ontology Management System (WOMS).

An entity within the personal knowledge graphs consist of these major parts:

- **Icon** - a visual representation of the entity, for instance a portrait of a person.
- **URI** - a unique resource identifier of an entity in the graph.
- **Type** - the type links to the defined concept class in the ontology.
- **Labels** - labels are the word(s) use in a language for the concept.
- **Description** - a short abstract that describes the entity.
- **Literals** - literals are properties of an entity, such as first name of a person. The ontology defines all literals of the concept class as well as its data type.
- **Relations** - the relationship among different entities is described using relations.

The following illustration provides an example for an entity:

![Entity description](https://github.com/Wacom-Developer/personal-knowledge-library/blob/main/assets/entity-description.png)

## Entity content

Entities in general are language-independent as across nationalities or cultures we only use different scripts and words for a shared instance of a concept.

Let's take Leonardo da Vinci as an example.
The ontology defines the concept of a Person, a human being.
Now, in English its label would be _Leonardo da Vinci_, while in Japanese _レオナルド・ダ・ヴィンチ_.
Moreover, he is also known as _Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci_ or _ダ・ビンチ_.

### Labels

Now, in the given example all words that a assigned to the concept are labels.
The label _Leonardo da Vinci_ is stored in the backend with an additional language code, e.g. _en_.

There is always a main label, which refers to the most common or official name of entity.
Another example would be Wacom, where _Wacom Co., Ltd._ is the official name while _Wacom_ is commonly used and be considered as an alias.

```

## Tools

The following samples show how to utilize the library to work with Wacom's Personal Knowledge.

  - _-t TENANT, --tenant TENANT_ - Tenant key to identify tenant
  - _-r, --relations (optional)_ -  Requesting the relations for each entity

### Dump script

Dump all entities of a user to a ndjson file. 

```bash
>> python  dump.py [-h] [-u USER] [-t TENANT] [-r] [-d DUMP]
```

**Parameters:**

  - _-u USER, --user USER_ - External ID to identify user of the Wacom Personal Knowledge 
  - _-t TENANT, --tenant TENANT_ - Tenant key to identify tenant
  - _-r, --relations (optional)_ -  Requesting the relations for each entity
  - _-d DUMP, --dump DUMP_ -  Defines the location of an ndjson file
 
### Push entities script

Pushing entities to knowledge graph.

```bash
>> python push_entities.py [-h] [-u USER] [-t TENANT] [-r]
```

**Parameters:**

- _-u USER, --user USER_ - External ID to identify user of the Wacom Personal Knowledge 
- _-t TENANT, --tenant TENANT_ - Tenant key to identify tenant
- _-i CACHE, --cache CACHE_ - Path to entities that must be imported.
