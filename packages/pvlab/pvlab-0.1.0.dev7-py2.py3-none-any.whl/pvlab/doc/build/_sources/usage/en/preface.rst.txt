The origin of |app| is a python tool, named ``calibration``, developed in 2019 in the laboratory |lab| at the |ciemat|, for its private use. It was originally designed to manage the big amount of data generated during the outdoor measurements, while performing the routine calibration of pyranometers.

Soon, both the *python programming language* and the ``calibration`` tool itself proved to be quick and reliable methods for data treatment. Gradually, the code grew in complexity, whereas new functionalities were enabled. Indeed, to the basic requirements of *data I/O* and a first block of calculations, some others joined, like fine data-filtering, tools for reports generation, graphics and further calibration records.

Finally, when it was concluded the development of the version 2.0.0 of the application ``calibration``, it made it clear that a formal package should be released, separately from the former tool. By doing so, some of the resources created are now at disposal of the community, under a 3-clause BSD License.

The path chosen for the development of |app| is that, as functions and classes created for its use at the |lab| are being adapted from their specific use at the |lab| to more general cases, and it is proved their robustness and performance, they will be progresively incorporated to the |app| library. In order to clarify the features and abilities of the objects created, docstrings of relevant functions or classess contain examples, which have been verified with the python built-in package ``doctest``.
