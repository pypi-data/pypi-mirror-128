  abstract = {Pymrio is an open source tool for Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output (EE MRIO) analysis developed in Python. It provides a high-level abstraction layer for global EE MRIO databases in order to simplify common EE MRIO data tasks. Among others, Pymrio includes parsers for several openly available EE MRIO databases (EXIOBASE v1 \textendash{} v3, WIOD, Eora26, OECD-ICIO) as well as methods for production and consumption based accounts calculation, aggregation, stressor origin estimation and visualization. The use of a consistent storage format including meta data and modification history for MRIOs allows to exchange data with other analysis tools, aiming for an increased interoperability of Industrial Ecology analysis software.},
