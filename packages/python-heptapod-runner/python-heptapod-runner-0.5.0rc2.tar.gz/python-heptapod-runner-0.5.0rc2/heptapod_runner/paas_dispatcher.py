    """Main backing class for the Heptapod PAAS Runner.

    This is a multi-threaded system that polls the coordinators on
    a regular basis to acquire jobs and starts auxiliary threads to launch
    them.

    Threads:

    - :attr:`event_processing_thread`: permanent thread that listens for
      events, maintains the mutable state and starts auxiliary threads.
      Even if shutdown is required, it waits for the auxiliary threads before
      exiting. The auxiliary threads are themselves supposed to finish as
      soon as possible if shutdown is required (e.g, by breaking out of
      retry loops etc.).
    - :attr:`launched_jobs_progress_threads`: jobs (running on the PAAS
      system) report their status directoy to the coordinator. This threads
      polls the coordinator regularly to check if they are finished and
      sends appropriate events.
    - laucher threads: spawned by the event processing thread, they are
      responsible for all provisioning and startup of jobs. They report
      back with events.

    Mutable state attributes:

    - :attr:`potential_concurrency`: number of parallel jobs we'll have
      if all those the coordinator gave us get launched successfully.

    - :attr:`shutdown_required`: boolean regularly checked by threads to
      terminate early if set. Must be set by :meth:`shutdown()` except in
      tests.

    - Job collections

      These all use :class:`JobHandle` directly or as keys.
      An important design invariant to maintain is that the event processing
      threads has write monopoly on them once it is started.

      + :attr:`pending_jobs` is a mapping from job handles to full job
        descriptions sent by the coordinator
      + :attr:`launched_jobs` contains all jobs currently fully launched
        and not yet known to be finished
