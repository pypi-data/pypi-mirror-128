FUNCTION
<<fedisableexcept>>---disable floating-point exception

INDEX
	fedisableexcept
SYNOPSIS
	#include <fenv.h>
	int fedisableexcept(int <[excepts]>);

	Link with -lm.

DESCRIPTION
This method attempts to disable the floating-point exceptions specified
in <[excepts]>.

RETURNS
If the <[excepts]> argument is zero or all requested exceptions were
successfully disabled, this method returns zero. Otherwise, a non-zero
value is returned.

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<fedisableexcept>>.

Not all Newlib targets have a working implementation.  Refer to
the file <<sys/fenv.h>> to see the status for your target.
