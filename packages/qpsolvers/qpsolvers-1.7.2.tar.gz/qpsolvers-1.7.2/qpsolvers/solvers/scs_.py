    Solve a Quadratic Program defined as:

            \\frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x \\\\

            & A x = h
        \\end{array}\\end{split}

    using `SCS <https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Primal quadratic cost matrix.
    q :
        Primal quadratic cost vector.
    G :
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h :
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A :
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b :
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    initvals :
        Warm-start guess vector (not used).
    verbose :
        Set to `True` to print out extra information.
    eps :
        Convergence tolerange.
    use_indirect:
        Solve linear systems either "directly" via a sparse LDL factorization
        or "indirectly" by means of a `conjugate gradient method
        <https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/scs_long.pdf>`_.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        Solution to the QP, if found, otherwise ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    As of SCS 2.1.2, the default convergence tolerance ``eps`` is set to
    ``1e-5``, resulting in inequality constraints that are violated by more
    than ``1e-6`` as opposed to ``1e-10`` for other solvers e.g. on the README
    problem. We lower it to ``1e-7`` and switch ``use_indirect=True`` so that
    SCS behaves closer to the other solvers on this example.

    All other keyword arguments are forwarded as is to SCS. For instance, you
    can call ``scs_solve_qp(P, q, G, h, use_indirect=True, normalize=True)``.
    See the solver documentation for details.
