`Forever Scalable`

**Quo** is a Python based toolkit for writing Command-Line Interface(CLI) applications.
Quo is making headway towards composing speedy and orderly CLI applications while forestalling any disappointments brought about by the failure to execute a CLI API.
Simple to code, easy to learn, and does not come with needless baggage. 

Quo requires Python `3.6.1` or later. 


## Features
- Support for ANSI and RGB color models
- Support for tabular presentation of data
- Interactive progressbars
- Code completions
- Nesting of commands
- Automatic help page generation
- Highlighting
- Lightweight

## Getting Started
### Installation
You can install quo via the Python Package Index (PyPI)

```
pip install -U quo
```


### Quo print
**Example 1**
```python
   import quo

   quo.echo(f"Hello, World!", fg="red", italic=True, bold=True))
```
![Hello World](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/print.png)

**Example 2**
```python
   import quo

   quo.echo(f"Quo is ", nl=False)
   quo.echo(f"scalable", bg="red", fg="black") 
```
![Scalable](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/scalable.png)

Unlike the builtin print function, ``echo`` function has improved support for handling Unicode and binary data.
It also supports handling of ANSI color sequences.

### Quo prompt
```python
   import quo

   quo.prompt("What is your name?")
```
![prompt](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/prompt.png)

### Quo log
```python
   import quo

   console = quo.Console()
   console.log("Quo status")

```

### Quo tabular
```python
   import quo


   table = [
     ["Name", "Gender", "Age"],
     ["Alice", "F", 24],
     ["Bob", "M", 19],
     ["Dave", "M", 24]
   ]

   quo.echo(quo.tabular(table))
```
![tabulate](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/tabulate.png)

### Quo Status
```python
   from time import sleep

   import quo

   console = quo.Console()

   tasks = [f"task {n}" for n in range(1, 11)]
   quo.echo(f"Working on tasks...", fg="green", bold=True)
   with console.status("[bold green] ",) as status:
       while tasks:
           task = tasks.pop(0)
           sleep(1)
           console.log(f"{task} complete")
```
