# Scheduling project: <TARGET>
> This is a template project to
  get started with Red Engine.

## Installing

```shell
cd <TARGET>
python -m pip install -e .
```

Note that we use flag `-e` to make the 
package editable: you don't need to reinstall
it after doing changes in the source code.

## Starting the scheduler

```shell
python -m my_package start
```

Or specify the `env`

```shell
python -m my_package start --env prod
```

## Run a specific task

```shell
python -m my_package run my_pytask_1 --env dev
```

## Development
