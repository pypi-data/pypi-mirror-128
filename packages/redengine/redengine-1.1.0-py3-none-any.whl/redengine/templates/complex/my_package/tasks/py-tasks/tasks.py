# Sequences (pipelines)
# ---------------------

# These are task pipelines: a task can run only
# when the previous task has succeeded. The first
# task in the pipeline can only run when the 
# interval is met or when the last task has succeeded
# if interval is not defined.

# The pipe starts every 10 seconds: every 10 seconds 
# both of these are allowed to run once and they must
# run in the specified order.
