## Core Features

- **Scheduling:** intuitive and powerful scheduling syntax.
    - All of these are valid instructions for scheduling a task:
        - `daily`
        - `every 2 hours, 10 minutes`
        - `weekly between Tuesday and Wednesday & after task 'another task'`
- **Parallelization:** run tasks in child processes or threads.
- **Parametrization:** parametrize individual tasks or share them inside a session. 
- **Easy start:** just install the package, use the premade configurations and get to it.
- **Extendable:** everything is just a building block designed for modifications. 

## Installation

```shell
pip install redengine
```

## How it looks like

```python
from redengine.tasks import FuncTask
from redengine import Session

session = Session()

@FuncTask(start_cond="daily between 10:00 and 15:00")
def my_task_1():
    ... # Do whatever.

@FuncTask(start_cond="after task 'my_task_1'")
def my_task_2():
    ... # Do whatever.

# Start scheduling
session.start()
```
