# Task directory
> This directory contains the tasks and pipes.
  Feel free to delete everything from this directory
  and create your own.

Note that you can also use the `my_package/settings.py`
to have session level models/configurations. 

For example have this in a `tasks.py`/`funcs.py`:

```python
from my_package.settings import my_setting
```
