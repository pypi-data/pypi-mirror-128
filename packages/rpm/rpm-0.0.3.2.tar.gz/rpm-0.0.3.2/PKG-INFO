# pypi-rpm

Dummy package reserved for any future possibility of having RPM Python API available through PyPI. Installing this package will not be completed as it is intended to be empty therefore installation failure will be thrown.

Right now, this package just reserves the `rpm` name on PyPI to avoid the
potential for a name conflict with the `python2-rpm` and `python3-rpm`
Python bindings on RPM-based Linux distros.

Unlike libsolv and libdnf (which use CMake, and are hence amenable to PyPI
compatible build automation with scikit-build), rpm itself still uses autotools to create.
