Description: The SolarcCalc module is used to predict hourly global solar radiation on a horizontal surface from daily average temperature extremes and total precipitation records. The method used in the calculations is based on that presented in [An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-1626-1) by Campbell, G.S. and J.M. Norman (1998).<br><br>Version 1.0 of the SolarcCalc module is based on the source code of SolarCalc.jar (version 1.1, Jan. 2006), a computer program  that was developped by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and that is available free of charge at [https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/solarcalc-10](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/solarcalc-10).<br><br>Subsequent versions of the SolarcCalc module implemented performance improvements and fixed some issues with the original code and method.
