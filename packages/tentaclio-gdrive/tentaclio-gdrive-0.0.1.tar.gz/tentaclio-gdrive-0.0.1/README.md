## Configuring access to google drive.
Google drive support is _experimental_ and should be used at your own risk. Also, due to google drive itself it's rather slow.

1. Get the credentials.
First we need a credentials file in order to be able to generate tokens. The easiest way to do this is by going to [this example](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python),
click on enable drive api. Give the project a name of your choosing (eg `tentaclio`), set the OAuth
client selector to "Desktop app", and download the generated JSON file.

2. Generate token file

```
pipenv install tentaclio && \
    pipenv run python -m tentaclio google-token generate --credentials-file ~/Downloads/credentials.json
```
This will open a browser with a google auth page, log in and accept the authorisation request.
The token file has been saved in a default location '~/.tentaclio_google_drive.json'. You can also configure this via the env variable `TENTACLIO__GOOGLE_DRIVE_TOKEN_FILE`

3. Get rid of credentials.json
The `credentials.json` file is not longer need, feel free to delete it.
