# Titania

This is framework made for VELO LHCb data visualization.
It's made to be fully customizable.

## Installation

You should start with downloading Titania framework through pip:

(recommended)
```
pip install git+https://gitlab.cern.ch/velo-calibration-software/titania
```

or with 
```
pip install titania
```

## Development installation

``` shell
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/velo-calibration-software/titania
cd titania
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting project


When you are ready to create skeleton for your monitoring project with command:

`python -m titania start --name NAME`

**REMEMBER TO REPLACE "NAME" WITH YOUR APPLICATION NAME**

Now you are ready to go! Look for **Quick Guide** to learn how to use this framework.

## Running tests
To run tests from CI sometimes it is needed to add:

`set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;src;tests`

## Run project

From main application folder u can run this script:

`python main.py`

**first you need to fill your main(look in our examples)**


# Quick Guide:
Ok, so lets say that you want add new tab to the your titania project:

Right here:

## First: Defining data

Thats very easy step. We store data related code at `data` module. You can find some implementations in framework core.
If the thing that you are looking for is not there, you should add your own class there. 
That is extending `TitaniaDataInterface` and putting it in `data` folder. It is very **simple**.
The only requirements are that your class have `fetch()` method, that returns the actual data.
Lets implement it with an example:

```python
import random
from titania.data.data_core import LovellDataInterface


class RandomNList(LovellDataInterface):
    def __init__(self, n=10):
        self.n = n

    def fetch(self):
        return [random.random() for i in range(self.n)]
```

And that's it!
(The `RandomNList` class can be found in package `titania.data`)

## Creating the Plot

We need something that we want to look at, we can easilly implement some kind of plot by extending `MplPlot`.
This class uses **Matplotlib** for plotting.
(If you would like to use any other plotting framework, you must at least extend `PlotInterface` class.)

```python
from titania.plots.base_plot import MplPlot

class OurPlot(MplPlot):

    def draw_plot(self):
        ax = self.figure.add_subplot()
        ax.plot(self.view.data.fetch())
        self.draw()
```

Very simple, we inherit from that class, and we only need to define `draw_plot`.
We already have `self.figure` as matplotlib object, as a property of MplPlot class.
We can save this as a python file in `plot` module.

##Part three, the prestige: Implementation of tab

### Creating new python file
We will create exemplary plot.
We will create file called `exemplary_gui.py`, and put it in views -> VELOView -> Exemplary -> exemplary_gui.py
Notice, that the `Exemplary` folder does **not exist, yet**.
This is because we are structuring the files used to create tabs, in similar way that we structure tabs themselves.
You can look around in `views` folder to see that this is true.
Although this is not necessary, this is the convention that we choose.

### Writing code

Now, we will create minimal implementation for new tab, line by line.

#### Tab class

```python

from titania.QtGUI import SimpleTab

class Exemplary(SimpleTab):
    pass
```

First we create tab class, in this case called `Exemplary`. 
All of the tab implementations need to implement at least class `QtTabInterface`.
This interface requires the following components:
 - **data** argument in constructor, as in `__init__(self, data)`. This object must inherit from LovellDataInterface.
 - **plot_panel_grid** - assigned in constructor
 - **lineLayout**  - assigned in constructor
 - **grid_layout**- assigned in constructor
 - Method **create_control_panel** - that creates panel for the tab
 - Method **set_title** - that returns the string with the name of the tab.
 - Method **initiate** - that is runned after the creation of tab object, when we want to draw it on gui.
But our class is using sub-class that is already implementing

The `QtTabInterface` class is inherited by `SimpleTab`,  `QtBaseLayoutTab`, `QtPlotTab`.
In most of the cases you should use them instead of inheriting directly from `QtTabInterface`.
**The recommended way is by subclassing `QtBaseLayoutTab`.**

The minimal requirements for inheriting from ``QtBaseLayoutTab`` are as follows:
 1. call `QtBaseLayoutTab` constructor with `data` argument 
 2. implement method **set_title**
 3. implement method **create_control_panel**
 4. implement method **set_plot**

Lets go back to our example

#### Data 

```python
from titania.QtGUI import QtBaseLayoutTab
from titania.data.data_core import EmptyLovellData

class Exemplary(QtBaseLayoutTab):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        QtBaseLayoutTab.__init__(self, data=EmptyLovellData(), parent=parent)

```

We added `EmptyLovellData` to the call of the constructor.
The data object must inherit from `LovellDataInterface`.
This interface only requirec implementation of `fetch()` method, that will return data.

#### Name 

Next we add the name of the tab, by implementing method `get_title`.

```python
    def get_title(self):
        return "example"

```

#### control panel

We add control panel, that we will use to navigate through the data.
```python
    def create_control_panel(self):
        return EmptyControlPanel()
```

For now we leave that empty, with `EmptyControlPanel`.

#### Plotting

Now we must define `set_plot`. It must return object that Inherits `PlotInterface`. But we can also use partially implemented `SimplePlot` that inherits from that interface.
```python
    def set_plot(self):
        return OurPlot(view=self)

```


#### It all comes together

Finally your file should look something like this:

```python
from titania.QtGUI import QtBaseLayoutTab
from titania.panels.main_control_panel import EmptyControlPanel
from titania.data.exemplary_generated_data import RandomNList
from titania.plots.our_plot import OurPlot

class Exemplary(QtBaseLayoutTab):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        QtBaseLayoutTab.__init__(self, data=RandomNList(), parent=parent)

    def get_title(self):
        return "example"

    def create_control_panel(self):
        return EmptyControlPanel()

    def set_plot(self):
        return OurPlot(view=self)

```

Save it in the file described in previous section.

Now run your application. Can you see the new Tab? Probably not, because we are missing one key factor.
*We need to add this class to the configuration*. 

### Configuration file

Open up file Config -> config.py. 

You can probably see something like this
```python
from view.VELOView.AreaPlotTestTab.stacked_area_plot_gui import StackedAreaTestTab
# ...
# (Long list of imports) 
# ...

config = {
    "VELOView": [ThresholdsTab, BoxPlotTestTab, StackedAreaTestTab, ScatterWithHistogramPlotTestTab, ScatterPlotTestTab, CountPlotTestTab],
    "RUNView": [PedestalsPlot, AnotherThresholdsPlot, PedestalsSingleMatrixPlot]
}
```

This is the actual place which **decides about the tabs placement**.
So add line that imports the created class, and add it to the list, like this:
```python
from view.VELOView.AreaPlotTestTab.stacked_area_plot_gui import StackedAreaTestTab
# ...
# (Long list of imports) 
# ...

from view.VELOView.ExemplaryPlotTab.exemplary_gui import Exemplary

config = {
    "VELOView": [ThresholdsTab, BoxPlotTestTab, StackedAreaTestTab, ScatterWithHistogramPlotTestTab, ScatterPlotTestTab, CountPlotTestTab, Exemplary],
    "RUNView": [PedestalsPlot, AnotherThresholdsPlot, PedestalsSingleMatrixPlot]
}
```

Now when you run your application you should be able to see your tab.

Of course, everything is empty. But now, with all of the knowledge that you gained, it should be easy for you to implement anything that you want to view here.



## New plot type

If you would like to create new plot, the easiest way is to inherit from `SimplePlot` class, and reimplement `draw_plot` method.

**Remember to use self.view.data.fetch() to get data!**

Then you can return your new plot object in `set_plot` method in your tab.
Take a look at GUIWidget -> PlotWindow -> Plot to get inspiration.
