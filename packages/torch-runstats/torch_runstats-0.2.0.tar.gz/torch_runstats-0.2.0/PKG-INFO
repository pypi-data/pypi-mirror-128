Description: # pytorch_runstats
        Running/online statistics for PyTorch.
        
        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pytorch-runstats/badge/?version=latest)](https://pytorch-runstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        `torch_runstats` implements memory-efficient online reductions on tensors. 
        
        Notable features:
         - Arbitrary sample shapes beyond single scalars
         - Reduction over arbitrary dimensions of each sample
         - "Batched"/"binned" reduction into multiple running tallies using a per-sample bin index. 
          This can be useful, for example, in accumulating statistics over samples by some kind of "type" index or for accumulating statistics per-graph in a `pytorch_geometric`-like [batching scheme](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/batching.html). (This feature is similar to [`torch_scatter`](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/scatter.html).)
         - Option to ignore NaN values with correct sample counting.
        
        **Note:** the implementations currently heavily uses in-place operations for peformance and memory efficiency. This probably doesn't play nice with the autograd engine â€” this is currently likely the wrong library for accumulating running statistics you want to backward through. (See [TorchMetrics](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a possible alternative.)

        ## Install
        
        `torch_runstats` requires PyTorch.
        
        The library can be installed from PyPI:
        ```bash
        $ pip install torch_runstats
        ```
        
        The latest development version of the code can also be installed from `git`:
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/mir-group/pytorch_runstats
        ```
        and install it by running
        ```bash
        $ cd torch_runstats/
        $ pip install .
        ```
        
        You can run the tests with
        ```bash
        $ pytest tests/
        ```
