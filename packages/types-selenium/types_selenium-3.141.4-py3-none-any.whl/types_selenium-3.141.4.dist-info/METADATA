## Typing stubs for selenium

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `selenium` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `selenium`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/selenium. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a5bc1e037fa9fb541d81de92ad27fa8543c65be4`.
