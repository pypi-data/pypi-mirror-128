log = LogWriter()
"""
    Instance of `xloil.LogWriter` which writes a log message to xlOil's log.  The level 
    parameter can be a integer constant from the ``logging`` module or one of the strings
    *error*, *warn*, *info*, *debug* or *trace*.

    Only messages with a level higher than the xlOil log level which is (initially) set
    in the xlOil settings file will be output to the log file. Trace output can only
    be seen with a debug build of xlOil.
