# e621-wrapper
A python3 "library" for using the e621 api.

# Dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install ratelimit
pip3 install requests
```

# Tutorial

Here is a quick example showing some stuff you can do with this library.

Where it says `YOUR-USER-AGENT` you should replace with something descriptive as said in the e621 api something like "Api-wrapper-test/0.1 (by *your-username*)". The other 2 arguments describe themselves.

```python3
import yiff

e6 = yiff.api("YOUR-E6-USERNAME", "YOUR-E6-API-KEY", "YOUR-USER-AGENT")
```

## Posts

Then you can do `e6.getpost(POSTID)` to get info about a post from its id and it will return an object with the "sub" python3 class. In this you can then do `sub.id, sub.tags, sub.score` etc etc.

Or if you want to search you can do `e6.search(LIST_OF_TAGS, POSTS_PER_PAGE, PAGE)` with list_of_tags being a list type and the other 2 being integers and it will return a list of `sub` class objects.

## Users

`e6.getuser(USER_ID)` is used to get info about a user from their id. It returns an object with the `user` class. you can then list `user.id, user.name user.forum_post_count` etc.

`e6.searchuser(USER_NAME)` works very similary to getuser except instead of taking their id it takes their username and out puts the same object.

## Extra

If you want all the values that can be returned from posts or user searches then just look at line 41 to line 91 for posts and line 95 to line 117 for users in [this](https://github.com/Blobadoodle/e621-wrapper/blob/main/yiff.py) file.
